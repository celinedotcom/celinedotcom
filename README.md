### 🚀 About Me

I'm currently enrolled in the **ALX Pro Frontend Development program**, where I'm sharpening my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **responsive web design**.  
My journey into software engineering began with a desire to blend creativity with logic — to build interfaces that are both useful and beautiful.

💡 I'm passionate about **creating intuitive user experiences**, and I’m inspired by how web technologies can empower communities, businesses, and everyday users.

🎯 My goal is to become a **professional full-time Frontend Developer** — and I’m building towards that every single day.
